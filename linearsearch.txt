#AIM:Store roll numbers of students who attended placement training program in random
#order in an array.
#a) Write a program to search whether a particular student attended training or not using linear search

#PROGRAM:
def unodr_linear_search(a, b, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if(a[i] == b):
            return 1
    return 0

array=[i.upper() for i in input("Enter roll numbers seperated by space : ").split()]
b=input("Enter the roll number you want to check: ").upper()
if unodr_linear_search(array,b,len(array)) == 1:
    print("Student with roll number",b,"attended for Placement training")
else: 
    print("Student with Roll number ",b,"not attended for Placement training")
#OUTPUT:
#Enter roll numbers seperated by space : 19121 19122 19123
#Enter the roll number you want to check: 19123
#Student with roll number 19123 attended for Placement training
